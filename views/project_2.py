<p style='text-align: justify; padding: 1px;'>
We observe two prominent spikes in cases, occurring in May-July 2021 and January-February 2022, which we will explore further.
<br>            
<b>First Spike: May-July 2021</b>
<br>           
In mid 2021, there was a significant increase in new cases. Although direct supporting data for this analysis is lacking, this spike coincides with the period following the Eid al-Fitr 
celebration, one of the largest holidays in Indonesia. Traditionally, this celebration is accompanied by mass travel, known as 'mudik', potentially leading to increased social interactions and mobility.

Without definitive data to link the spike solely to the Eid celebration—such as mobility reports or social interaction levels—it's reasonable to hypothesize that major events like Eid al-Fitr 
could potentially influence the spread of the virus, based on general understandings of infectious disease transmission.

<b>Second Spike: January-February 2022</b>
<br>
A significant increase occurred in early 2022, coinciding with the emergence of the highly transmissible Omicron variant globally. Again, while specific data to prove direct causality in 
Indonesia is absent, global patterns suggest that the spread of the Omicron variant contributed to increased cases in many countries, likely including Indonesia

<b>Discussion</b>
<br>
When analyzing this data, it's important to remember that seeing a trend doesn't necessarily mean one event causes another. Without more data, we should avoid making firm conclusions. 
Nonetheless, these observations point out the need for more detailed analysis to better understand the factors affecting COVID-19 case trends.
<br>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<br>
This chart provides valuable insights into the dynamics of COVID-19 spread in Indonesia, illustrating the importance of public health policies and effective monitoring. Furthermore, it 
underscores the necessity for preparedness in facing potential future surges, which could be triggered by large social events or the emergence of new variants.

<b>Second Spike: January-February 2022</b><br>
The graph shows a strong correlation between the rise and fall of new cases and new recoveries. 
This suggests that as more people are diagnosed with COVID-19, more people recover, likely due to the concurrent handling of these cases within the healthcare system.
<br><b>Second Spike: January-February 2022</b><br>
There is a noticeable increase in deaths that accompanies the rise in new cases during 2021. However, during the surge in 2022, the increase in deaths is less 
pronounced compared to the increase in cases. This could potentially be attributed to several factors, such as improved treatments or higher vaccination rates.
